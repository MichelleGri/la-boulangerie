The La Boulangerie website advertises a fictional bakery business. Based in London, the business sells sweet and savoury baked goods, and cold and hot drinks. The target customers for the bakery are people looking for a wide variety of delicious freshly baked food in a single bakery, made from quality ingredients. La Boulangerie is a family-run business that prides in providing distinctly tasty food and beverages made from secret family recipes. Customers have the option to either ‘take away’ their order or there is seating available for customers who want to enjoy their food and/or beverages in the tranquil environment of the bakery. The website provides information regarding the wide range of products available, the bakery location, contact information (phone number, email address, and a form to send messages), and the business opening and closing days and times.

## Features

### Existing Features

### Homepage

#### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar appears on all four pages of the website. This enables the user to easily move between pages without having to use the ‘back’ function. The navigation bar includes the bakery logo of the left side of the page, which returns to user to the homepage when clicked. The other four links included on the navigation bar are: Home, Menu, Gallery, and Contact Us. The navigation bar is responsive on multiple screen sizes, and it moves to under the logo on small screen, such as mobile devices. Although ‘Menu’ is included in the navigation bar, this page has not yet been created. 

#### Landing Page image
The landing page image is a photo of four cupcakes lined up horizontally. It aims to capture the visitors attention and encourage them to investigate further. The vibrant yet subtle colours on the main image, set against a light grey background colour, intend to entice the user to visit the bakery. The fruit on the main image gives the impression of freshness and well-being. 

#### About Us section
Set in the middle of the page, this section aims to provide a little information regarding the bakery. 
It is further sectioned into two parts - an image of the bakery on the right, and some text about the bakery on the left. 
The section informs the user that the bakery is based in London and began operating in 1998. The ‘cakes and croissants’ and ‘sweet and savoury’ words have been highlighted in blue (the company logo colour) to place emphasis that the bakery is able to cater for the needs of people wanting to consume either sweet or salty baked goods. 
The bakery image on the right is a watercolour painting of the bakery from the outside. This aims to give a character and sense of ‘old-fashioned’ heritage. 

#### Bakery Menu section
The bakery menu is located at the bottom of the landing page. It presents four images of different types of products sold at La Boulangerie: Breads and Savouries, Sweets and Desserts, Cakes, and Drinks. The idea is to link each image to the relevant part of the section of the main bakery Menu page. Although this section is included, the ‘Menu’ page has not yet been created. Therefore, currently the link leads to the top of the homepage. There is a hover effect that includes the names of the categories set on white background with an opacity so that the image below is slightly visible on hover. 

#### Footer
The footer is featured on all four pages of the website. It is identical on all pages and appears at the bottom of the page. There are three sections included within the footer:

* Opening Times – this section gives information regarding the business opening and closing days and times. This is important as customers need to be aware of when to visit the bakery. 

* Contact Us – this section lists the bakery phone number, address, and email address. Along with providing the bakery address, this section gives the users two options on how to contact the bakery – a phone number and email. 

* Social Media – this part of the footer provides links to the bakery’s social media platforms – Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This encourages the user to stay connected and interact with the company. These pages enable the business to advertise the bakery and announce promotional offers, discounts, and events. The social media icons are clickable links to the relevant page which opens in a new tab.  As La Boulangerie is a fictional business, the links currently lead to the website homepage.

## Gallery Page

The gallery page includes 14 photos relevant to the bakery, presented in a masonry style. This pages aims to give the user an idea of the bakery’s ambience and the products sold. It’s purpose is to convince the user to visit the bakery and have an enjoyable experience. The user is able to visualise the bakery and therefore set their expectations accordingly. 

## Contact Us Page
The contact us page includes two panels. The left panel enables the user to complete a short and simple form with their name and contact details, and to send a message to the company. The right panel includes details of how to find the bakery.

### Contact Page - 'Contact Us'

There is also a question that allows the user to either opt-in or opt-out to the mailing list to receive email newsletters, offers and vouchers. The name, phone number, and email address inputs are set to required so that the user is unable to send the message unless these fields have been completed. The message/feedback input field is set to optional. By default, the option to opt-in or opt-out of the mailing list is set to ‘No’. This is to avoid anyone being accidently added to the mailing list if they do not wish to do so. Sending a message will result in the user being informed that their message has been sent and someone will be in contact with them shortly. However, as this website is for educational purposes only, submitting a message currently leads to the formdump.codeinstitute.net page. 

### Contact Page – ‘How to Find Us’
The ‘How to Find Us’ panel is on the right side of the page and includes a google map of the bakery’s location, the bakery address, phone number, and email address. The map includes a ‘View larger map’ link that opens in a new tab where the user can input their own postcode to receive travel instructions to the bakery.

### Features that can be added in the future

#### Company History
A ‘Company History’ page can be included to provide more information about the company’s history – how it all began and it’s evolution. This may include a section about the company values, its involvement in the community, and the sourcing of its ingredients. 

#### Online Ordering
An option to ‘order online’ can be included on every page of the website. This may include links to some popular online ordering services, such as UberEats and Deliveroo. Another option can be included to ‘Click and Collect’ the order. 

#### Cake Orders
A page can be created to provide users to order cakes for birthdays, weddings, and any other special occasions. This may provide the user with an option to choose from a variety of cakes and include a personalised message on the cake. An option can be included for the user to submit a message or make a phone call to discuss any specific needs. 

#### Customer Account
A ‘Customer Account’ page can be added that will enable the customers to login to their account while making purchases online. This may be accompanied with a card that can be used at the bakery to accumulate points and receive special offers and discounts.

## Design

### Imagery
The main hero-image on the homepage has been included as it provides simple combination to the bakery’s unique selling points – fresh, unique, and quality. The brightly coloured fruits provide a vibrant energy, while the grey background adds depth to the overall website. The remaining images on the website are of paintings and drawings to provide character to the bakery. This also provides consistency for images throughout the website. 

### Colour Scheme
The site was created with a very simple colour scheme of shades of blues and greys. It was important to use subtle colours on the site as the images are bright and vibrant. This ensures that the user is not overwhelmed by many and contrasting colours. A colour picker was used on this specific part of the hero image to select the colours. 

Four colours were chosen for the colour palette using the website www.canva.com/colors. 

Midnight blue (#191970) – this colour is used for the logo and to highlight certain phrases on the about-us section. 
Grape (#494454) – this colour is used for text on the site. 
Light blue-grey (#CDDEEE) – this colour is used for the footer background.
White Smoke (#F0F0F0) – this colour is used for background of the whole site. 
The suitability of these colours for accessibility and readability purposes was checked using two websites: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ and https://imagecolorpicker.com/color-code.
Here are the results which confirmed suitability of this colour palette.


### Typography
The two main font styles used throughout the website are: Manrope and Poppins. The logo has been styled using the ‘Shadows Into Light’ font. All three fonts have been imported from Google Fonts into styles.css. The logo font aims to add style and distinctiveness to the bakery logo. Manrope and Poppins were chosen as they compliment each other and are easily legible. 

### Logo
The logo was designed using the ‘Shadows Into Light’ font, imported from Google Fonts. This font gives a style and character to the logo to make it distinctive. The colour ‘midnight blue’ (#191970) was selected for the logo using the colour picker on the hero image.
